\quote{When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty but
when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is
wrong. We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims.
There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a
butterfly. Love is metaphysical gravity. Don't fight forces, use them.
Integrity is the essence of everything successful. Everyone is born a
genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.}
